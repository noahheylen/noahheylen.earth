    <p>A lot of CCTV-cameras are hacked, telling something different than the name
of the place or time and date. I spread a poem, generated by an AI about
CCTV-footage, across eight different cameras. Each owner of the camera
saw a different part of the poem, not knowing the underlying connection to
other cameras, nor my work. Each owner reacted to the poem as well, some
in the form of typing ‘WTF?’ or ‘Who dis?’ onto the camera, others adding
actual security to the CCTV-camera or removing the camera as a whole. Over
the past few months, the work has crumbled into a digital ruin. Now, the
only connection holding the cameras together isn’t the poem, it is myself.
I made a video telling the poem three times.</p>
